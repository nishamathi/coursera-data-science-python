# Applied Data Science with Python Specialisation
 More information about this program can be accessed through this  [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).
 
## Prerequisites
Individuals are expected to have some experience with programming in python.

## About
In this five-course specialisation we are introduced to data science through the python programming language. Upon completion of this specialisation, we can apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insights into our data.

This program is offered in collaboration with following academic partner: 
- [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu)

Estimated Duration: 5 Months  <br/>
Program Structure: Self-Paced with 6 Hours Per Week

## Curriculum

###  1. Introduction to Data Science in Python
In this introductory lesson, we are introduced to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. This course introduces data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduces the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with help on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. 

### 2. Applied Plotting, Charting and Data Representation in Python
In this lesson, we are introduced to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. This course starts with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations.  It later focuses on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduces us to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. It later demonstrates a variety of basic statistical charts that help us to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. It ends with a discussion of other forms of structuring and visualizing data.

### 3. Applied Machine Learning in Python
In this lesson, we are introduced to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. This course starts with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduces the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data is discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, is tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models are described, through which we can apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). This course ends with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. 

### 4. Applied Text Mining in Python
In this lesson, we learn text mining and text manipulation basics. This course begins with an understanding of how text is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating text. Later we focus on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and preparing text for use by machine learning processes. Then we apply basic natural language processing methods to text, and demonstrate how text classification is accomplished. Finally, we explore more advanced methods for detecting the topics in documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modelling).

### 5. Applied Social Network Analysis in Python
In the last lesson, we are introduced to network analysis through tutorials using the NetworkX library. This final course begins with an understanding of what network analysis is and motivations for why we might model phenomena as networks. We further learn the concept of connectivity and network robustness and explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. Finally, we explore the evolution of networks over time and cover models of network generation and the link prediction problem.
